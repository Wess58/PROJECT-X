## Description

Making art is a passionate activity by dedicated individuals. Creating new paintings, drawings, sculptures, or photographs is time consuming and you still need to find time to present your work to new audiences.For any artist, whether your art career is just starting, or if you've already got a big following marketing and finding just the appropriate audience is quite a headache.This website is aimed at providing artists in out time with a tool to help with the issue of marketing their art and more so bridging the apparent gap amongst artists.It's pretty hard to for artists find a community where they can share their ideas and skills since art is broad and incredibly dynamic.We provide a platform for emerging and established artists to exhibit, promote, and share their works with an enthusiastic, art-centric community. Our members upload thousands of original pieces of art every day, everything from breathtaking paintings and sculptures to pencil art, unimaginable digital art, pixel art or even show-stopping murals.
